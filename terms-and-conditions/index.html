            <p class="txt">Welcome! Before you use the services of Casino Classic ("Platform", "We"), you must carefully
                read these General Terms and Conditions ("Agreement"). This Agreement is entered into between you and

                terms. For matters not provided for in this Agreement, additional rules and policies may apply.</p>

            <h2>How to Properly Use Casino Classic Services</h2>
            <p class="txt">The platform should only be used for personal entertainment purposes. All users must create
                and verify an account before playing with real money. In case of technical problems during the gaming
                process, you must immediately contact customer support. It is your responsibility to keep all your
                financial transactions under control and regularly check your account activity.</p>

            <h2>Strict Age Verification and Legal Compliance Policy</h2>
            <p class="txt">To use the services of Casino Classic, you must be at least 19 years of age (or the legal age
                of majority in your province). To verify your age, appropriate documents may be requested from you.
                Accounts without age verification will be blocked or deleted. In accordance with the legislation of
                Canada, gambling activities are only permitted for individuals who have reached the legal age. By
                confirming that you are of legal age, you confirm that the platform complies with these requirements.

            <h2>Mandatory Acceptance of Terms and Ongoing Updates</h2>
            <p class="txt">This Agreement may be amended. We will inform you about changes via our website or by email
                notification. By continuing to use our services after changes, you accept the new terms. The current
                version of the terms will always be published in this section of our website. All parts of the Agreement
                are interconnected and the invalidity of one part does not diminish the validity of the other parts.</p>

            <h2>Clear Account Blocking and Termination Policy</h2>
            <p class="txt">We may block or terminate your account without prior notice or notification if we believe you
                have violated our rules. If your account is blocked or terminated, you lose the right to access the

            <h2>Disclaimers and Effective Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p class="txt">Disputes related to this Agreement should first be resolved through negotiations. If no
                agreement can be reached, the dispute will be settled in accordance with the laws of Canada. You agree
                to use the official complaint procedure before contacting us. The invalidity of one part of the
                Agreement does not diminish the validity of the other parts.</p>

                <h1>Casino Classic – Advocates for Safe and Balanced Gaming</h1>

                <p class="txt">
                    Casino Classic is continuously committed to ensuring that your gaming experience remains always
                    entertaining, safe, and controlled. Responsible gambling is a fundamental principle of our platform
                    activities. We believe that gaming should only be a source of entertainment and relaxation. On this
                    page, we provide you with the tools and information you need to manage risks, develop healthy
                    habits, and seek appropriate help when needed.
                </p>

                <h2>Proven Strategies for Healthy and Entertaining Gaming</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    There are several basic principles for developing healthy gaming habits. First, gaming should not be
                    viewed as a source of income but as entertainment. Set a budget and strictly adhere to it – this
                    helps minimize financial losses. Balance gaming with other activities: sports, social contacts,
                    family time. At Casino Classic, you have access to internal tools such as deposit limits, time
                    reminders, and session restrictions to assist you.
                </p>

                <h2>Recognizing Warning Signs Before Problems Arise</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    It is very important to recognize the early signs that gaming is negatively affecting your life in a
                    timely manner. These signs may include: spending more time and money than planned, sleep
                    disturbances due to gaming, neglecting work or educational responsibilities, accumulation of debts,
                    and weakening of social relationships. If you notice any of these signs in yourself, it's time to
                    reassess your gaming behavior and set limits.
                </p>

                <h2>Debunking Common Gambling Myths and Misconceptions</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    There are many myths surrounding gambling, and understanding them helps reduce risks. "I will
                    definitely win" – gambling is a random event and outcomes are not predictable. "I need to win back
                    my losses" – this can lead to even greater losses. "I have a strategy" – in most games of chance,
                    any long-term strategy leads to losses. Recognizing these myths and approaching gaming with
                    realistic expectations is a wiser and more responsible approach.
                </p>

                <h2>Self-Assessment Tools to Keep Your Gaming Under Control</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    Casino Classic offers internal tools to help players assess their situation. You can set daily,
                    weekly, and monthly deposit limits, set time limits for each gaming session, and determine loss
                    limits. Reality checks remind you of how long you've been playing and how much you've spent. These
                    tools work automatically and help you maintain self-control.
                </p>

                <h2>Support Systems for Families Affected by Gambling Addiction</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    Gambling problems can affect not only the player but also their environment. If someone in your
                    family or close circle has a gambling problem, it is important to seek support and information.
                    Responsible gambling organizations offer counseling and psychological support services to family
                    members. Casino Classic facilitates contact with such organizations to support early problem
                    resolution.
                </p>

                <h2>Contact Trusted Professionals for Help and Counseling</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    If gaming is negatively affecting your life, do not hesitate to seek professional help. Casino
                    Classic facilitates contact with trusted and anonymous support services. You can also seek help from
                    psychologists, therapists, and specialized centers. Seeking help is a sign of strength and the first
                    step toward problem-solving. Our customer support on the platform is always ready to inform you
                    about appropriate resources.
                </p>

                <h2>Protection of Minors and Commitment to Responsible Gambling</h2>
                <p class="txt">
                    Casino Classic takes strict measures to prevent individuals under 19 years of age from gambling (age
                    of majority in most Canadian provinces). All players must undergo age verification during
                    registration. We recommend families activate parental control programs, protect personal data, and
                    take measures to prevent children's access to gambling sites. Responsible gambling is a fundamental
                    requirement for the well-being of both players and society.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    As Casino Classic, we are committed to protecting our users. We would like to remind you that the
                    Casino Classic app and the Casino Classic online platform offer tools for self-determined gaming.
                    When you use the Casino Classic login, you have access to all safe gaming features. We encourage you
                    to gamble responsibly and know your limits. Your entertainment and safety are our top priority. Keep
                    these principles in mind while continuing to play and always maintain control. If you need help, we
                    are here for you.
